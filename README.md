# Submission for Shopify Backend Developer / Data Engineer Winter 2022 Intership

*Please note: You need to include a ".env" file in the client folder and "default.json" inside config. The application will not be able to make requests without these files. The content of both have been described in my shopify application. There were withheld from github as they contained confidential information such as db keys.*

Hi! This is my submission for the backend developer internship position at Shopify.

It's a basic image repository by taking inspiration from websites like Imgur. I used the MERN stack to implement my own solution.

Currently, a user has the ability to:
- Register, login and logout themselves
- Upload an image with a caption
- Delete an image that only they've posted
- Ability to view all images uploaded to the repository

## How? 

For the frontend, 
- **React.js**
- **CSS5**
- **Axios**
- **Material-UI** for simplistic front end utilities

For the backend,
- **MongoDB** for user storage
- **AWS S3** for image storage
- **Express**
- **Node**
- **Bcrypt** and **jwt** for user authentication

## Note

Please excuse the lack of alerts for situations where a user might enter a wrong password and such.
The project was completed in three day's time while also completing other school assignments.
